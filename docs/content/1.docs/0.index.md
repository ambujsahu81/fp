# Welcome to fp_

## Overview

`fp_` is a functional programming library for Deno. It is mostly a personal project that I started because there wasn't a good functional programming library for Deno, and also I wanted to learn more about functional programming. I have ambitious goals for this project, and I hope to make it the most complete and well documented functional programming library for Deno.

## Who is this for?

This is for people experienced or beginning to dabble into the world of functional programming. `fp_` will always be well documented, and I will try to make it as easy to use as possible.

## Status

`fp_` is currently in development, and is not ready for production use. I will be adding more features and documentation as I go along.
